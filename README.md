Data Analytics Dashboards

Problem Statement : Create a dashboard that provides following insights for users and management.

1) Identify Popular Investments: Utilize historical data on customer investments to determine the most popular investment choices among users. Display a list of the top-performing mutual funds, fixed deposits (FDs), and stocks based on customer preferences, with a focus on the top 10 in each category.

2) Top-Performing Investments: Highlight investments that have generated the highest returns over time, allowing users to explore potential high-return options.
   
3) Identify High-Net-Worth Investors: Identify and categorize 'rich' investors based on their portfolio size or other relevant criteria, helping the bank target specific services or promotions to this segment.

4) Historical Returns: Offer a visualization of the total returns for the past six months on a monthly basis for the top 5 customers with the highest portfolios, allowing users to track their investment performance over time.

5) Tax Assessment: Offer a visualization of the expected tax liability for the current assessment year based on the user's portfolio. Provide users with insights into their tax obligations.
  Simplified assumption for tax calculations:
  Gains from mutual funds redeemed within one year are taxed at 15%. If the same is redeemed after one year, the gains over Rs.1 lakh are taxed at 10%.
  Gains from stocks sold within one year are taxed at 15%. If the same are sold after one year, the gains over Rs.1 lakh are taxed at 10%.
  Gains from FD taxed at 10%.
