Data Analytics Dashboards

Problem Statement : Create a dashboard that provides following insights for users and management.

Identify Popular Investments: Utilize historical data on customer investments to determine the most popular investment choices among users. Display a list of the top-performing mutual funds, fixed deposits (FDs), and stocks based on customer preferences, with a focus on the top 10 in each category.
Top-Performing Investments: Highlight investments that have generated the highest returns over time, allowing users to explore potential high-return options.
Identify High-Net-Worth Investors: Identify and categorize 'rich' investors based on their portfolio size or other relevant criteria, helping the bank target specific services or promotions to this segment.
Historical Returns: Offer a visualization of the total returns for the past six months on a monthly basis for the top 5 customers with the highest portfolios, allowing users to track their investment performance over time.
Tax Assessment: Offer a visualization of the expected tax liability for the current assessment year based on the user's portfolio. Provide users with insights into their tax obligations.

Simplified assumption for tax calculations:
Gains from mutual funds redeemed within one year are taxed at 15%. If the same is redeemed after one year, the gains over Rs.1 lakh are taxed at 10%.
Gains from stocks sold within one year are taxed at 15%. If the same are sold after one year, the gains over Rs.1 lakh are taxed at 10%.
Gains from FD taxed at 10%.
